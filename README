Cuckoo DXL Python Client Library
===========================================================

Overview
--------

The Cuckoo DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for invoking Cuckoo API commands via the
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_ (DXL) fabric.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to invoke cuckoo commands without having to focus
on lower-level details such as cuckoo specific DXL topics and message formats.

This client requires a cuckoo DXL service to be running and available on the DXL fabric.
